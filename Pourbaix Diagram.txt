Pourbaix Diagrams is a diagram that help us get to know thermodynamical and corrosion possibility of materials in variation of pottential and PH value.also there are disadvantages that limit its usage like considering states of reaction and materials at only room temperature(25 Centigrade).In this project Pourbaix diagram have been simulated based on thermodynamical calculation for Cu(copper) and its oxidation and reduction.
